      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sinan Aksoy is a discrete mathematician specializing in (hyper)graph theory and network science. In addition to his theoretical research in spectral and extremal graph theory, he applies graph theoretic methods to study complex systems arising from varied domains, including social networks, power and communication systems, and high performance computing. His work focuses on developing widely applicable methodologies that draw from probability, linear algebra, and combinatorics.&lt;/p&gt;
