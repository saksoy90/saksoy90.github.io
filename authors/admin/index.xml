      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sinan Aksoy is a discrete mathematician specializing in graph theory and network science. In addition to his theoretical research in spectral and extremal graph theory, he also in interested in applying graph theoretic methods to study complex systems arising from social networks, power and communication systems, and cyber security. In these domains, his work focuses on developing methodologies that draw from probability, statistics, and combinatorics.&lt;/p&gt;
