Much of the current analysis of hypergraphs relies on first performing a graph expansion – either based on the nodes (clique expansion), or on the hyperedges (line graph) – and then running standard graph analytics on the resulting representative graph. However, this approach suffers from massive space complexity and high computational cost with increasing hypergraph size. Here, we present efficient, parallel algorithms to accelerate and reduce the memory footprint of higher-order graph expansions of hypergraphs. Our results focus on the hyperedge-based s-line graph expansion, but the methods we develop work for higher-order clique expansions as well. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first framework to enable hypergraph spectral analysis of a large dataset on a single shared- memory machine. Our methods enable the analysis of datasets from many domains that previous graph-expansion-based models are unable to provide. The proposed s-line graph computation algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication methods, and obtain approximately 2 − 31 X speedup over a prior state-of-the-art heuristic-based algorithm for s-line graph computation.","tags":["hypergraphs","HPC"],"title":"High-order Line Graphs of Non-uniform Hypergraphs: Algorithms, Applications, and Experimental Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Koby Hayashi","Sinan G Aksoy","Haesun Park"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"38b252f6f4fbf8e5f126b1052bee725c","permalink":"/publication/hayashi-2022-skew/","publishdate":"2022-07-02T15:38:54.185717Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hayashi-2022-skew/","section":"publication","summary":" Cut-based directed graph (digraph) clustering often focuses on finding dense within cluster or sparse between-cluster connections, similar to cut-based undirected graph clustering methods. In contrast, for flow-based clusterings the edges between clusters tend to be oriented in one direction and have been found in migration data, food webs, and trade data. In this paper we introduce a spectral algorithm for finding flow-based clusterings. The proposed algorithm is based on recent work which uses complex-valued Hermitian matrices to represent digraphs. By establishing an algebraic relationship between a complex-valued Hermitian representation and an associated real-valued, skew-symmetric matrix the proposed algorithm produces clusterings while remaining completely in the real field. Our algorithm uses less memory and asymptotically less computation while provably preserving solution quality. We also show the algorithm can be easily implemented using standard computational building blocks, possesses better numerical properties, and loans itself to a natural interpretation via an objective function relaxation argument.","tags":["spectral graph theory","directed graphs"],"title":"Skew-Symmetric Adjacency Matrices for Clustering Directed Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xu T.

To date, in most situations, entities in a hypergraph are considered connected if there is at least one common neighbor. However, minimal commonality sometimes discards the strength of connections and interactions among groups. To this end, considering the width of a connection, referred to as the s-overlap of neighbors, provides more meaningful insights into how closely the communities or entities interact with each other. In addition, s-overlap computation is the fundamental kernel to construct the line graph of a hypergraph, a low-order approximation of the hypergraph which can carry significant information about the original hypergraph. Subsequent stages of a data analytics pipeline then can apply highly tuned graph algorithms on the line graph to reveal important features. Given a hypergraph, computing the s-overlaps by exhaustively considering all pairwise entities can be computationally prohibitive. To tackle this challenge, we develop efficient algorithms to compute s-overlaps and the corresponding line graph of a hypergraph. We propose several heuristics to avoid execution of redundant work and improve performance of the s-overlap computation. Our parallel algorithm, combined with these heuristics, is orders of magnitude (more than 10x) faster than the naive algorithm in all cases and the SpGEMM algorithm with filtration in most cases (especially with large s value).","tags":["hypergraphs","HPC"],"title":"Parallel Algorithms for Efficient Computation of High-Order Line Graphs of Hypergraphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Svitlana Volkova","Dustin Arendt","Emily Saldanha","Maria Glenski","Ellyn Ayton","Joseph Cottam","Sinan Aksoy","Brett Jefferson","Karthnik Shrivaram"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635724800,"objectID":"ebde85c57f29ed9ad19678242c0f2cdb","permalink":"/publication/volkova-2021/","publishdate":"2022-07-02T15:38:54.186606Z","relpermalink":"/publication/volkova-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Ground Truth program was designed to evaluate social science modeling approaches using simulation test beds with ground truth intentionally and systematically embedded to understand and model complex Human Domain systems and their dynamics. Our multidisciplinary team of data scientists, statisticians, experts in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and visual analytics had a unique role on the program to investigate accuracy, reproducibility, generalizability, and robustness of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) causal structure learning approaches applied to fully observed and sampled simulated data across virtual worlds. In addition, we analyzed the feasibility of using machine learning models to predict future social behavior with and without causal knowledge explicitly embedded. In this paper, we first present our causal modeling approach to discover the causal structure of four virtual worlds produced by the simulation teams—Urban Life, Financial Governance, Disaster and Geopolitical Conflict. Our approach adapts the state of-the-art causal discovery (including ensemble models), machine learning, data analytics, and visualization techniques to allow a human-machine team to reverse engineer the true causal relations from sampled and fully observed data. We next present our reproducibility analysis of two research methods team’s performance using a range of causal discovery models applied to both sampled and fully observed data, and analyze their effectiveness and limitations. We further investigate the generalizability and robustness to sampling of the SOTA causal discovery approaches on additional simulated datasets with known ground truth. Our results reveal the limitations of existing causal modeling approaches when applied to large-scale, noisy, high-dimensional data with unobserved variables and unknown relationships between them. We show that the SOTA causal models explored in our experiments are not designed to take advantage from vasts amounts of data and have difficulty recovering ground truth when latent confounders are present; they do not generalize well across simulation scenarios and are not robust to sampling; they are vulnerable to data and modeling assumptions, and therefore, the results are hard to reproduce. Finally, when we outline lessons learned and provide recommendations to improve models for causal discovery and prediction of human social behavior from observational data, we highlight the importance of learning data to knowledge representations or transformations to improve causal discovery and describe the benefit of causal feature selection for predictive and prescriptive modeling","tags":["social networks"],"title":"Explaining and predicting human behavior and social dynamics in simulated virtual worlds: reproducibility, generalizability, and robustness of causal discovery methods","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sinan G Aksoy","Emilie Purvine","Stephen J Young"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1634256000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634256000,"objectID":"403d5d440bc0c5e111feb56c87b3d506","permalink":"/publication/aksoy-2021-directional/","publishdate":"2021-11-08T02:13:22.056704Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aksoy-2021-directional/","section":"publication","summary":"Cyber operations is drowning in diverse, high-volume, multi-source data. To get a full picture of current operations and identify malicious events and actors, analysts must see through data generated by a mix of human activity and benign automated processes.

We introduce a general method rooted in spectral graph theory to discover patterns and anomalies without a priori knowledge of signatures. We derive and propose a new graph-theoretic centrality measure based on the derivative of the graph Laplacian matrix in the direction of a vertex. To build intuition about our measure, we show how it identifies the most central vertices in standard network datasets and compare to other graph centrality measures. Finally, we focus our attention on studying its effectiveness in identifying important IP addresses in network flow data. Using both real and synthetic network flow data, we conduct several experiments to test our measure’s sensitivity to two types of injected attack profiles and show that vertices participating in injected attack profiles exhibit noticeable changes in our centrality measures, even when the injected anomalies are relatively small, and in the presence of simulated network dynamics.","tags":["spectral graph theory","cyber security"],"title":"Directional Laplacian Centrality for Cyber Situational Awareness","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sinan G.

We derive analytic expressions for the spectral gap, bisection bandwidth, and diameter of these topologies, some of which were previously unknown.

To inform the model design, we analyse the properties of power grid graphs derived from the U.S. Eastern Interconnection, Texas Interconnection and Poland transmission system power grids. Across these datasets, we find subgraphs induced by nodes of the same voltage level exhibit shared structural properties atypical to small-world networks including low local clustering, large diameter and large average distance. On the other hand, we find subgraphs induced by transformer edges linking nodes of different voltage types contain a more limited structure, consisting mainly of small, disjoint star graphs. The goal of our proposed model is to match both these inter and intra-network properties by proceeding in two phases: the first phase, adapts the Chung-Lu random graph model, taking desired vertex degrees and desired diameter as inputs, while the second phase of the model is based on a simpler random star graph generation process. We test the model’s performance by comparing its output across many runs to the aforementioned real data. In nearly all categories tested, we find our model is more accurate in reproducing the unusual mixture of properties apparent in the data than the Chung-Lu model. We also include graph visualization comparisons, a brief analysis of edge-deletion resiliency, and guidelines for artificially generating the model inputs in the absence of real data.","tags":["power grid","graph generation"],"title":"A generative graph model for electrical infrastructure networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emilie Purvine","Sinan Aksoy","Cliff Joslyn","Kathleen Nowak","Brenda Praggastis","Michael Robinson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"8c64d93bb684dd195e07ebe628b959e9","permalink":"/publication/purvine-2018/","publishdate":"2019-08-25T20:38:53.057963Z","relpermalink":"/publication/purvine-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"As data accumulate faster and bigger, building representational models has turned into an art form.

This article is focused on generative models of large-scale bipartite graphs, also known as two-way graphs or two-mode networks. We propose two generative models that can be easily tuned to reproduce the characteristics of real-world networks, not just qualitatively but quantitatively. The characteristics we consider are the degree distributions and the metamorphosis coefficient. The metamorphosis coefficient, a bipartite analogue of the clustering coefficient, is the proportion of length-three paths that participate in length-four cycles. Having a high metamorphosis coefficient is a necessary condition for close-knit community structure. We define edge, node and degreewise metamorphosis coefficients, enabling a more detailed understanding of the bipartite connectivity that is not explained by degree distribution alone. Our first model, bipartite Chung–Lu, is able to reproduce real-world degree distributions, and our second model, bipartite block two-level Erdös–Rényi, reproduces both the degree distributions as well as the degreewise metamorphosis coefficients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these models on several real-world data sets.","tags":["hypergraphs","graph generation"],"title":"Measuring and modeling bipartite graphs with community structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sinan G.

In the first half of this thesis, we examine random walks on directed graphs, which is rooted in the study of non-reversible Markov chains. We prove bounds on key spectral invariants which play a role in bounding the rate of convergence of the walk and capture isoperimetric properties of the directed graph. We first focus on the *principal ratio*, which is the ratio of maximum to minimum values of vertices in the stationary distribution. Improving upon previous bounds, we give a sharp upper bound for this ratio over all strongly connected graphs on $n$ vertices. We characterize all graphs achieving the upper bound and give explicit constructions for these extremal graphs. Additionally, we show that under certain conditions, the principal ratio is tightly bounded. We then turn our attention to the first nontrivial Laplacian eigenvalue of a strongly connected directed graph. We give a lower bound for this eigenvalue, extending an analogous result for undirected graphs to the directed case. Our results on the principal ratio imply this lower bound can be factorially small in the number of vertices, and we give a construction having this eigenvalue factorially small.\n\nIn the second half, we apply spectral tools to study orientations of graphs. We focus on counting orientations yielding strongly connected directed graphs, called *strong orientations*. Namely, we show that under a mild spectral and minimum degree condition, a possibly irregular, sparse graph $G$ has many strong orientations. More precisely, given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, orient each edge in either direction with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ independently. We show that if $G$ satisfies a minimum degree condition of $(1+c_1)\\log_2{n}$ and has Cheeger constant at least $c_2\\frac{\\log_2\\log_2{n}}{\\log_2{n}}$, then the resulting randomly oriented directed graph is strongly connected with high probability.

In this note we describe two related adjustments to SOSM with the intention to address the same inefficiency issue. In one we create possibly artificial coalitions among students where some students modify their preference profiles in order to improve the outcome for some other students. Our second approach involves trading cliques among students where those involved improve their assignments by waiving some of their priorities. The coalition method yields the EADAM outcome among other Pareto dominations of the SOSM outcome, while the clique method yields all possible Pareto optimal Pareto dominations of SOSM.
