abstract: "As data accumulate faster and bigger, building representational models has turned into an art form. Despite sharing common data types, each scientific discipline often takes a different approach. In this work, we propose representational models grounded in the mathematics of algebraic topology to understand foundational data types. We present hypergraphs for multi-relational data, point clouds for vector data, and sheaf models when both data types are present and interrelated. These three models use similar principles from algebraic topology and provide a domain-agnostic framework. We will discuss each method, provide references to their foundational mathematical papers, and give examples of their use."
