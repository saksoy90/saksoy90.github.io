abstract: " Cut-based directed graph (digraph) clustering often focuses on finding dense within cluster or sparse between-cluster connections, similar to cut-based undirected graph clustering methods. In contrast, for flow-based clusterings the edges between clusters tend to be oriented in one
direction and have been found in migration data, food webs, and trade data. In this paper we
introduce a spectral algorithm for finding flow-based clusterings. The proposed algorithm is based
on recent work which uses complex-valued Hermitian matrices to represent digraphs. By establishing an algebraic relationship between a complex-valued Hermitian representation and an associated
real-valued, skew-symmetric matrix the proposed algorithm produces clusterings while remaining
completely in the real field. Our algorithm uses less memory and asymptotically less computation
while provably preserving solution quality. We also show the algorithm can be easily implemented
using standard computational building blocks, possesses better numerical properties, and loans itself
to a natural interpretation via an objective function relaxation argument."
