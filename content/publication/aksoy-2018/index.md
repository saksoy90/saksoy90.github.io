abstract: "We show the minimum spectral gap of the normalized Laplacian over all simple, connected graphs on $n$ vertices is $(1+o(1))\\tfrac{54}{n^3}$. This minimum is achieved asymptotically by a double kite graph. Consequently, this leads to sharp upper bounds for the maximum relaxation time of a random walk, settling a conjecture of Aldous and Fill. We also improve an eigenvalueâ€“diameter inequality by giving a new lower bound for the spectral gap of the normalized Laplacian. This eigenvalue lower bound is asymptotically best possible."
