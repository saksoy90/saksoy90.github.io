abstract: "Phasor measurement units (PMUs) allow voltage
angle differences across power grids to be monitored
to identify sudden shifts associated with system
disturbances. The Eastern Interconnection Situational
Awareness and Monitoring System (ESAMS) was
developed to identify such wide-area disturbances and
summarize them in reports released the following day.
Demonstration of ESAMS in North America’s Eastern
Interconnection revealed the need for an effective visual
summary of the disturbance’s impact on voltage angle
pairs. This paper proposes the use of the circular
variance, a measure of dispersion applicable to angular
data, for this purpose. Results based on PMU data from
North America’s Eastern and Western interconnections
indicate that the circular variance provides useful
summaries of wide-area voltage angle measurements.
They also show that the circular variance may have
potential uses when applied to historical data to identify
unusual grid conditions."
